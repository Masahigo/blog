# Prologue

After working over 10 years in different roles in the IT industry I felt like I needed a change. I needed to break the routine and jump out of my comfort zones into the unknown. I had started to build love for devops and more often found myself avoiding other areas in projects. How cool would it be if I could just concentrate into this one area and develop my skills there to the fullest?

Well, my wish became reality when I joined PolarSquad on the 1st of October 2018. This was the biggest leap of faith I have done during my career so far and it has felt like the right one from day one.

This blog is a result of my desire to share my learnings..
