## Prologue

After working over 10 years in different roles in the IT industry I felt like I needed a change. I needed to break the routine and jump out of my comfort zones into the unknown. I had started to fall in love with devops and more often found myself avoiding other areas in projects. How cool would it be if I could just concentrate into this one area and develop my skills there to the fullest?

Well, my wish became reality when I joined [PolarSquad](https://www.polarsquad.com/) on the 1st of October 2018. This was the biggest leap of faith I have done during my career so far and it has felt like the right one from day one. Docker is no longer a stranger to me and running builds using containers is super nice. Coming from MS background where containers are not yet an everyday thing there's always something new to learn.

This blog is a about my journey into the world of modern devops with an MS twist to it.

## How this blog was born

I had been thinking about starting my own blog for several years already but had not had the proper time nor motivation to get started with it. After jumping into a new company it felt like the right time - "just do it".

1. _where am I going to host this website_? I had been learning about **Google Cloud Platform** recently and was anxious to try out something real there so this was a no brainer to me.

1. _what platform am I going to use for the blog or will I build it myself_. I had been reading about JAMStack a year ago and found one particular static website generator called **Hexo** which felt like a good choice so I went with that.

1. _what service in GCP should I utilize for hosting a static website_? After going through all the possible options the **App Engine (Standard)** seemed like the best option - PaaS service that supports CNAMEs and SSL certs, what's not to like? It also downscales well so running cost is minimal.
