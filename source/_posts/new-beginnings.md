# Prologue

After working over 10 years in different roles in the IT industry I felt like I needed a change. I needed to break the routine and jump out of my comfort zones into the unknown. I had started to fall in love with devops and more often found myself avoiding other areas in projects. How cool would it be if I could just concentrate into this one area and develop my skills there to the fullest?

Well, my wish became reality when I joined PolarSquad on the 1st of October 2018. This was the biggest leap of faith I have done during my career so far and it has felt like the right one from day one. Docker is no longer a stranger to me and running builds using containers is super nice. Coming from MS background where containers are not yet an everyday thing there's always something new to learn.

This blog is a about my journey into the world of modern devops with an MS twist to it.
