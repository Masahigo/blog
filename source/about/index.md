# Meet the dude

Hi, my name is Masi. I come from Finland and I work as a DevOps Consultant and Azure Lead for `The best DevOps company*` in the northern periphery: [PolarSquad](https://www.polarsquad.com/).

My professional background includes over 10 years of working with MS technologies and developing web-based solutions. I love to learn new things and embrace change - learning out from the old is crucial in this industry.

My OS of choice is Windows 10 Pro and my favorite text editor is VSCode.

I hope you enjoy your stay!
